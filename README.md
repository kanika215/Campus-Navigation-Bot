## Project Overview
The **Campus Navigation Bot** simulates navigation in a campus environment.  
It leverages **reinforcement learning** to find optimal paths between starting and goal points.  

Key points:  
- Supports multiple algorithms: **Q-Learning**, **SARSA**, and **Monte Carlo Control**.  
- Visualizes the path and value function using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.  
- Calculates the **cost** and **steps** for each path.  

---

## Features
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook with organized code cells.  
- Automatic calculation of **optimal paths**.  
- Visualizations of:  
  - Path on campus map 🡆  
  - State value heatmaps  
  - Algorithm comparison for cost and steps

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**
